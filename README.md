# The FBI’s Twitter Shorthand Guide

> With the advent of Twitter and other social media venues on the Internet, the use of shorthand and acronyms has exploded. The DI’s Intelligence Research Support Unit (IRSU) has put together an extensive — but far from exhaustive — list of shorthand and acronyms used in Twitter and other social media venues such as instant messages, Facebook and MySpace.
>
> This list has about 2800 entries you should find useful in your work or for keeping up with your children and/or grandchildren. We’ll continue to update/expand this list. If you have some suggestions for additions, feel free to add a new entry by clicking on the “New” tab below.

## What

A list of terms compiled by the FBI for Twitter Shorthand / leet speak. The list was made public through a Freedom of Information Request by Muckrock. The source file is a PDF scan of a printed website, which is (deliberately) made hard to read. The goal of this repository is to make the list available as a CSV.

Since most OCR software struggle with this PDF, the document will need to be transcribed manually. Pull requests for specific pages welcome.
