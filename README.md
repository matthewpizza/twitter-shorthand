# The FBIâ€™s Twitter Shorthand Guide

## What

A list of terms compiled by the FBI for Twitter Shorthand / leet speak. The list was made public through a Freedom of Information Request by Muckrock. The source file is a PDF scan of a printed website, which is (deliberately) made hard to read. The goal of this repository is to make the list available as a CSV.

Since most OCR software struggle with this PDF, the document will need to be transcribed manually. Pull requests for specific pages welcome.
